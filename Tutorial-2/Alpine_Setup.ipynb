    "To begin, you'll need software to access the remote terminal and the file trasnfer system. [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is a prgoram that combines file transfer and terminal control into one package. [Putty](putty.org) is a remote terminal application that can be combined with [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), a file sharing program. Either download MobaXterm or both Putty and WinSCP. This tutorial will use Putty and WinSCP, but you could follow along in MobaXterm."
