    "This section will only use the terminal, so open Putty and start the connection to Alpine the same way we did in the previous tutorial. Once you enter the terminal, you should be met with a green cursor following a line of text.\n",

    "Next is <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">cote3804</span></code>. This is just a user-name, and you should recognize your CU ID in the first line of your terminal. This is followed by <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">@login12</span></code>, which refers to the node I logged into on Alpine. It isn't important to know which node you're on, unless you're experiencing issues and need to report them to Research Computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">~</span></code> symbol refers to my _root_ directory. More on this later.
