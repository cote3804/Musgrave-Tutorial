During this phase, the initial structure will be \"relaxed,\" meaning the nucleus positions will be shifted to lower the forces between them and minimize the total energy. These forces are generated by running DFT and solving the many body problem for the electrons and are then used by a minimization algorithm to change nuclear positions.
