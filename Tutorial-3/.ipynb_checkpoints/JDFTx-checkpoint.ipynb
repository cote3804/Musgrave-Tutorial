    "The Ionic Relaxation is the majority of the computational time and is highly important. During this phase, the initial structure will be \"relaxed,\" meaning the nucleus positions will be shifted to lower the forces between them and minimize the total energy. This is done by running a DFT calculation to get electronic structure properties such as the forces between nuclei. Those forces are then used by a minimization algorithm to change nuclear positions. We can set both energetic and force related convergence criteria, which we'll do later. A structure is considered relaxed when it clears the force/energy convergence criteria we set.\n",

The following tags are used to take the forces generated from the electronic structure and use them to change the nuclear positions. We'll specify both force and energy convergence criteria. The energy convergence criteria is ```energyDiffThreshold 1e-6```, which means that the calculation will be converged if two consecutive calculations are within 1e-6 Hartree of each other. The force crtieria is ```knormThreshold 1e-4```, which means that the calculation will be converged if the [norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/VectorNorm.html) of the force vector is below 1e-4 Hartree/Bohr. We'll also add a maximum number of nuclear steps before the calculation finishes. We do this by setting the ```nIterations``` tag to the number of maximum steps.
